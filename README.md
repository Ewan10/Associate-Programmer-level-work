# Associate-Programmer-work
During  my self-study on C++ I already gained the following skillset that an experienced programmer posesses:
1)	Familiarity with the syntax for a variety of programming constructs. Avoiding syntax typing errors.
2)	Breaking down a complex code or design and study it in small parts or by removing the details and reschemating the new major points and concepts of focus to be understood and mastered. 
3)	Debugging. Write test code to understand the behaviour of ambiguous or complex code. Isolating the biggest part of extensive code during compilation and incorporating step by step a small part at a time to the already functioning code and monitor that it functions correctly.
4)	Develop sense for graphical representation of the code and data structures to comprehend and describe the operations of the code and the relations of the interweaved data structures such as nested classes, factory methods, methods returning objects used by third classes etc. Sense for use of memory/data diagrams, flow charts, UML. 

IDEs/packages: Eclipse for C++, Java, codeblocks, VScode, python interpreter, online Linux command line simulator, MATLAB, microcontroller assembly language.
